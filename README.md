# Pocket-Lawyer

Not much yet, just an idea for an app:
Pocket Lawyer is meant to act kind of like Wikipedia for local and state laws, Users could submit city ordinances or state statutes. Users could then search for local laws that pertain to a subject such as "New Years firework restrictions", or "Curfews for minors".
